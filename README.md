*  Instructions: 1) This program is implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. But it is also succesfully	      *
*					tested in Visual Studion 2008 and 2010 with minor changes.                                              *
*				 2) Basic purpose of this program is to read color images from the database text file, compute the        *
*				    PCTs, QPCTs, and RQPCTs and write the features into a file.                                           *
*				 3) After succesfull build, allocate the memory to the program as follows: 1) click the "project"         *
*				    button, click on "PHTs properties", click on "Linker", click on "System", allocate 100000000          *
*					in "Stack reserve size".                                                                                *
*				 4) Sample database file is provided "Colorimagereadwrite.txt" which contains two images.                 *
*                5) If you have any issue regarding program execution feel free to communicate on the above       *
*					contact information.                                                                                    *
